# Jonathan's Backupper
This is an incremental backupping program.
You specify the folder that you want to backup, and the folder you want to place the backup in.
The program will then check for files that differ between both directories (i.e. have been changed since last
backup or simply haven't been backupped yet) and copy only those. (Very rudimentary backupping technique, not suitable for e.g. source code)

# Languages
The currently supported languages are:
* EN (English)
* NL (Nederlands)
