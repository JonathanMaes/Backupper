# Jonathan's Backupper
This is an incremental backupping program.
You specify the folder that you want to backup, and the folder you want the place the backup in.
**The program will then check for files that differ between both directories (i.e. have been changed since last
backup or simply haven't been backupped yet) and copy only those.**
