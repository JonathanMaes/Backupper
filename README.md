# Backupper
This is an incremental backupping program.
You specify the folder you want to backup and the folder to backup to.
The program will check for files that are different in both directories.

The .exe is quite a bit slower than the .bat file in the Distributable folder.

It is therefore recommended to *use the Distributable/Backup.bat file instead of the .exe if python is installed*.
If python is not installed, the .bat file will obviously not work, while the .exe file will.
